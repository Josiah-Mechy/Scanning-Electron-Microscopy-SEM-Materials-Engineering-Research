## Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) – Materials Engineering Research
This repository contains our group research project on Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), completed for ENGM 310 – Materials Engineering. The project included a comprehensive technical paper and accompanying presentation created by:
- Josiah Farinacci
- Trevor Jaastad
- Cyrus Harri

## Project Overview
This project explores the function, value, and classroom relevance of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). SEM is a high-resolution imaging method used to study the surface topography and composition of materials. It plays a vital role in analyzing failure, microstructure, and material performance—essential themes in materials science.

## Our Research Paper Covers:
-How SEM Works: Inner workings, electron beam mechanics, and detector signals
-What SEM Shows: Topographic, compositional, and crystallographic information
-Why SEM Matters: Industrial and academic applications, including connections to class topics such as phase diagrams, failure mechanisms, and alloy structures

## Key Class Connections:
-Phase Diagrams: SEM can reveal α/β phase distributions and be combined with EDS for compositional analysis
-Failure Analysis: Scanning Electron Fractography is a core SEM application used to evaluate fracture modes in polymers and metals
-Materials Properties: SEM supports studies of grain boundaries, brittleness, elasticity, and tensile strength

## What I Learned from the SEM Project:
- Fundamentals of Electron Microscopy: Gained an understanding of how a scanning electron microscope uses a focused electron beam and electromagnetic lenses to produce high-resolution surface images.
- Material Characterization Applications: Explored how SEM is used to identify phases in metals, study crystal structures, and analyze fracture surfaces in failure investigations.
- Relevance to Engineering Practice: Connected SEM applications to core topics in materials engineering like phase diagrams, fracture mechanisms, and alloy behavior.
- Practical Research & Communication Skills: Strengthened my ability to synthesize technical information, collaborate with teammates, and communicate findings through both writing and oral presentation.
